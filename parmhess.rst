Parameterization using Parmhess
===============================

Once the inputs are prepared, simply run:

.. code-block::  bash

   parmhess.py input.inp

Parmhess will read inputs and invoke **g09** command to do necessary MM calculations. These files will be generated:

1. Folder **hffiles**, includes all temporary files. They are used to calculate lowercase :math:`h` (see the paper).
2. Result MM input file including generated parameters. Named as PHF/FHF/IHF_result_mmXXX.com.



Acceptable arguments:


::

  [rwang013@boonlay-h00 parmhess]$ parmhess.py -h
  usage: parmhess.py [-h] [--quiet] [--nocalc] inputinp

  positional arguments:
  inputinp       input.inp prepared by tsubasa.

  optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --quiet, -q    Do not show info on screen
  --nocalc, -nc  Use already calculated file.


1. :code:`inputinp` A compulsory argument. The :code:`input.inp` file generated by **Tsubasa**, including the names of QM and MM input files.

2. :code:`-q` :code:`--quiet` Normally, messages will be both printed on the screen and write in a :code:`.tsubasa` file. Specify this argument to remove the messages on the screen (can be used with :code:`&` to work at background).

3. :code:`-nc` :code:`--nocalc` If the program has successfully run once already and files in :code:`hffiles` folder exists, this argument just read these files and give the results quickly (normally for debug purpose).


An example is as follow:
