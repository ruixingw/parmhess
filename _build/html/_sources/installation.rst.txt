============

**Python3 (Anaconda)**

**Parmhess** is written in Python3 and runs on Linux.

The easiest way to setup Python3 is to install **Anaconda**. It is freely available at https://www.anaconda.com/download/.

You should choose Anaconda for Linux (Python3.X), not Python2.7 nor for other operating system. Simply run :code:`bash Anaconda3-x.x.x-Linux-x86_64.sh` to start the installation and follow the instruction. Root access is not necessary. 

If you are an experienced Python3 user and prefer to use your own Python build, make sure that **numpy** and **pyyaml** be installed properly.

**Gaussian 09 (G09)**

QM and MM calculation is performed by Gaussian 09.

Any revision of G09 should work. However, there is a bug in G09 Rev. B.01 and thus special attention is needed in MK charge calculation. If you only have G09 B01, read the workaround in: http://ambermd.org/bugfixesat.html

**AmberTools**

AmberTools is used to identify the atom types and calculate RESP charges. After you have Anaconda installed, a simple command could be used to install a light version of AmberTools:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install ambertools -y -c http://ambermd.org/downloads/ambertools/conda/


Then, run antechamber and you should see the help of usage.
